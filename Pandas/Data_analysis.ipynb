Data pre processing is often called data cleaning or data wrangling. Steps in Data wrangling:\n","# 1. Identify and handle missing values:\n","  A missing value condition occurs whenever a data entry is left empty. \n","  Usually, missing value in dataset appears as question mark, N/A, zero or just a blank cell. \n","  Ways to fix it:\n","  - Remove the data where that missing value is found. \n","  - When you drop data, you could either drop the whole variable or just the single data entry with the missing value. \n","  - If you don't have a lot of observations with missing data, usually dropping the particular entry is the best. If you're removing data, you want to look to do something that has the least amount of impact. \n","  - Replacing data is better since no data is wasted. However, it's less accurate since we need to replace missing data with a guess of what the data should be.\n","  - One standard replacement technique is to replace missing values by the average value of the entire variable.\n","  - Replace it by no.of frequency.\n","  - Replace it based on other function.\n","# 2. Data formatting:\n","  Data from different sources may be in various formats, in different units, or in various conventions. We need to standardize the values into the same format, or unit, or convention.Example: We mention India as India or IN.\n","\n","  Data is usually collected from different places, by different people, which may be stored in different formats. Data formatting means bringing data into a common standard of expression that allows users to make meaningful comparisons.\n","  \n","# 3. Data Normalization:\n","  Different columns of numerical data may have very different ranges, and direct comparison is often not meaningful. Normalization is a way to bring all data into a similar range for more useful comparison. \n","  - Example that will help you understand why normalization is important. Consider a data set containing two features: age and income, where age ranges from 0 to 100, while income ranges from 0 to 20,000 and higher. Income is about 1,000 times larger than age and ranges from 20,000 to 500,000. So these two features are in very different ranges. When we do further analysis, like linear regression, for example, the attribute \"income\" will intrinsically influence the result more due to its larger value. But this doesn't necessarily mean it is more important as a predictor. So the nature of the data biases the linear regression model to weigh income more heavily than age. To avoid this, we can normalize these two variables into values that range from 0 to 1.\n","  There are several ways to normalize data. Some techniques are mentioned below. \n","  - The first method, called simple feature scaling, just divides each value by the maximum value for that feature. This makes the new values range between 0 and 1. \n","  - The second method, called min max, takes each value x underscore old, subtracts it from the minimum value of that feature, then divides by the range of that feature. Again, the resulting new values range between 0 and 1. \n","  - The third method is called Z-score, or standard score. In this formula, for each value, you subtract the mu, which is the average of the feature and then divide by the standard deviation sigma. The resulting values hover around zero and typically range between negative three and positive three, but can be higher or lower.\n","  \n","# 4. Data binning:\n"," Binning creates bigger categories from a set of numerical values. It is particularly useful for comparison between groups of data.\n"," Binning as a method of data preprocessing. Binning is when you group values together into bins. For example, you can bin age into 0-5, 6-10, 11-15 and so on. \n"," Sometimes binning can improve accuracy of the predictive models.\n","\n","# Additional tip: Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python.\n"," Most statistical models cannot take in objects or strings as input, and for model training, only take the numbers as inputs. In the car data set, the fuel type feature as a categorical variable has two values; gas or diesel which are in string format. For further analysis, Jerry has to convert these variables into some form of numeric format. We encode the values by adding new features corresponding to each unique element in the original feature we would like to encode. In the case where the feature fuel has two unique values, gas and diesel, we create two new features, gas and diesel. When a value occurs in the original feature, we set the corresponding value to one in the new feature, the rest of the features are set to zero.\n","\n","*Note:*\n","Axis 0 means row\n","Axis 1 means

Numerical variables should have type 'float' or 'int', and variables with strings such as categories should have type 'object'. For example, the numerical values 'bore' and 'stroke' describe the engines, so you should expect them to be of the type 'float' or 'int'; however, they are shown as type 'object'. You have to convert data types into a proper format for each column using the \"astype()\" method.</p> \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"419db9f6-9556-4363-b742-c0c0050924e1","metadata":{},"source":["<h4>Convert data types to proper format</h4>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"id":"0a2791f8-a0fc-4f68-b796-19dc7293e55b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df[[\"bore\", \"stroke\"]] = df[[\"bore\", \"stroke\"]].astype(\"float\")\n","df[[\"normalized-losses\"]] = df[[\"normalized-losses\"]].astype(\"int\")\n","df[[\"price\"]] = df[[\"price\"]].astype(\"float\")\n","df[[\"peak-rpm\"]] = df[[\"peak-rpm\"]].astype(\"float\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"796693e0-a859-410c-8033-bae3427c3b6a","metadata":{},"source":["<h4>Let us list the columns after the conversion</h4>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"id":"bfdeebb8-aa26-4df3-be6f-fc75f024d0a7","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["symboling              int64\n","normalized-losses      int32\n","make                  object\n","fuel-type             object\n","aspiration            object\n","num-of-doors          object\n","body-style            object\n","drive-wheels          object\n","engine-location       object\n","wheel-base           float64\n","length               float64\n","width                float64\n","height               float64\n","curb-weight            int64\n","engine-type           object\n","num-of-cylinders      object\n","engine-size            int64\n","fuel-system           object\n","bore                 float64\n","stroke               float64\n","compression-ratio    float64\n","horsepower            object\n","peak-rpm             float64\n","city-mpg               int64\n","highway-mpg            int64\n","price                float64\n","dtype: object"]},"execution_count":25,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df.dtypes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"070823db-7d53-4afc-a41e-a5649a913a27","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Standardization\n","<p>\n","You usually collect data from different agencies in different formats.\n","(Data standardization is also a term for a particular type of data normalization where you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.)\n","</p>\n","    \n","<b>What is standardization?</b>\n","<p>Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format, allowing the researcher to make the meaningful comparison.\n","</p>\n","\n","<b>Example</b>\n","<p>Transform mpg to L/100km:</p>\n","<p>In your data set, the fuel consumption columns \"city-mpg\" and \"highway-mpg\" are represented by mpg (miles per gallon) unit.
